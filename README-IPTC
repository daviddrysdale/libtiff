--text follows this line--

I've finished merging a forked libtiff that was being shipped with
ImageMagick (that added IPTC newsphoto support) with the last libtiff
release (tiff-v3.4beta037).    I'm going to make this available at
ftp://ftp.onshore.com/pub/libtiff (as tiff-v3.4beta037-IPTC). 

I'm very reluctant to fork code, and I woud refrain, but for the following: 

    1.  Repeated mail to you about the patches has gone unanswered.

    2.  I keep getting mail from people strugging to get IPTC newphoto support
        to work properly with ImageMagick. 

    3.  The NT source distibution was already shipping with a forked version.

In order for the situation to be less confusing, I'm going to make an
archive of the forked version available.

I very much would like for there not to be a fork.  Are you still
maintaining libtiff?  If not, is there a current maintainer? 

I'm willing to adopt it if there isn't.  I'd hate to see such an
important library fragment.  It's extremely likely that onShore
(http://onshore.com/), will donate web space, bandwidth, and listserv
services if so.
