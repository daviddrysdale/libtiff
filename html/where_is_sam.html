This site came to be without the blessing of Sam Leffler.  We couldn't
get ahold of him.   We really would have liked to have obtained it. 

<p> 

Attempts to track down Sam at SGI were unsuccessful (he moved on
without providing a forwarding address).  There were reports of a
sighting at Pixar, but their operators didn't have any record of him.
people.yahoo.com didn't have any current e-mail addresses, and while
Mike did manage to dig up a home number for a Sam Leffler in CA, he
was loathe to call the poor guy at home.  So, Sam, if you're reading,
we hope you don't mind us stealing your baby -- it's just that there
was a forked version being shipped with the Imagemagick NT
distribution, and forks are a bad thing. 

<p> 

Since SGI hosted the master ftp site for v3.4beta037, we contacted
them instead, and recieved their permission to assume maintenance,
since there wasn't directly a person it was currently assigned to.
